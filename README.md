# Arabic POS System (C# WinForms)

This is a simple Point of Sale (POS) desktop application developed in C# using Windows Forms. The application supports Arabic language and provides essential POS functionality such as item and customer management, invoice generation (buy/sell/returns), and data persistence via a structured SQL database access layer.

## 🧩 Architecture

The application follows a **3-layer architecture**:

1. **UI Layer**: Windows Forms (`MainForm`, `EditInv`, `EditItems`, `EditCustomers`, `Browsing`)
2. **Logic/Queries Layer**: Business logic and data validation are handled through mapped `POSData` utility methods.
3. **Database Connection Layer**: Handles direct SQL queries and communication with the database (`connection.cs` assumed).

## ✅ Features

- 📦 Add, edit, and delete **Items**
- 👤 Add, edit, and delete **Customers** (buyers or sellers)
- 🧾 Create and edit **Invoices**:
  - Sales invoices
  - Purchase invoices
  - Return invoices (for both sales and purchases)
- 📊 Browse and filter records by date and type
- 🔐 Admin authentication for edit/delete actions
- 🔍 Search and date filters on all browsing screens
- 🎯 Arabic labels and RTL layout support
